description:
 This check monitors the performance of each (on-premise) backend system
 connected to a SAP Cloud Connector instance.

 The backend performance metrics are grouped into 22 buckets for each
 backend system by the SAP Cloud Connector monitoring API. In each bucket,
 those backend calls are counted whose runtime matches the buckets timing
 window definitions.

 The following metrics are provided by this check:

 {calls_total} The rate (calls per second) of overall calls. The absolute
 number of overall calls is also reportet in the service state.

 {calls_min_10_ms}, {calls_min_20_ms}, {calls_min_30_ms}, {calls_min_40_ms},
 {calls_min_50_ms}, {calls_min_75_ms}, {calls_min_100_ms}, {calls_min_125_ms},
 {calls_min_150_ms}, {calls_min_200_ms}, {calls_min_300_ms}, {calls_min_400_ms},
 {calls_min_500_ms}, {calls_min_750_ms}, {calls_min_1000_ms}, {calls_min_1250_ms},
 {calls_min_1500_ms}, {calls_min_2000_ms}, {calls_min_2500_ms}, {calls_min_3000_ms},
 {calls_min_4000_ms}, {calls_min_5000_ms} The individual call rate for
 each of the buckets.

 With the two thresholds {runtime_warning} and {runtime_critical} the calls
 in the above buckets are devided in three sets: {calls_ok} for the sum of
 all calls in buckets with a runtime lower than {runtime_warning}, {calls_warn}
 for the sum of all calls in buckets with a runtime higher than {runtime_warning}
 and lower than {runtime_critical} and {calls_crit} for the sum of all calls
 in buckets with a runtime higher than {runtime_critical}.

 The metrics {calls_pct_ok}, {calls_pct_warn}, {calls_pct_crit} provide the
 relative amount of calls in each of the three sets. The relative number
 of calls in the set {calls_pct_warn} is compared to the {warning} threshold.
 The relative number of calls in the set {calls_pct_crit} is compared to
 the {critical} threshold.

 Default levels for warning and critical {runtime} are 500 and 1000 milliseconds.
 Default levels for warning and critical {percentage} are 10 and 5 percent.
 These are configurable via WATO.

item:
 The item is a string derived from concatenating the configuration values
 {protocol}, {virtualHost} (hostname or FQDN) and {virtualPort} (TCP port)
 on the SAP Cloud Connector for each of the connections to the backend
 systems.

inventory:
 The inventory creates one service for every (on-premise) backend system
 connected to the monitored SAP Cloud Connector instance.
